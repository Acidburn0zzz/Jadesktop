##JADE
JADE a linux desktop built with web techonlogies, HTML5, Javascript, Python, CSS, Gtk, Webkit2.

JADE is a modern DE. Jade does not try to hide things way from the user, and reduces nested clicking for a modern workflow. Jade is not meant to be a full blown DE, and is meant to be complemented by 3rd party applications.

At the moment it only offers basic functionality, runs applications, shuts down your system, allows access to recently used files, provides application search, displays the current time and total disk usage in a pleasant way to the user. 

### Why web techonlogies?
Most ( Non-Technical ) people i know, dont know how to use a computer properly, most dont know what linux is or that they carry it in their pockets in a daily basis. But they all have one thing in common, they all use the browser to buy, go to social networks or check their email.

### Why did i build this?

I built JADE out of my desire of learning python and i was in need of an interface for my personal use, in the living room PC that was easy to use and hack into. Later on i decided to adapt Jade for desktop use, family end friends said this seems easy to use in comparison to their current PC interfaces. So i decided to release Jade under the GPL license, maybe someone else will like to use it.

This is a Protoype desktop, developer build preview, and it is unfinished. JADE is subject to changes at any time and is not ready for daily use.

Development:

I will be adding more functionality as i need it without bloat, as i want it simple and snappy. If you have an idea that is a good fit open an issue. 

If there is something you can't find or do inside the interface open an issue, as i consider interface design problems a bug.

If you find a problem in the code open an issue.

Issues might take me a while to resolve but i will eventually fix them when i get spare time.
